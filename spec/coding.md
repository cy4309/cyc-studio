# Coding Guidelines

## General

- Keep components small and focused
- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- One main responsibility per file

## React

- Functional components only
- Hooks at top level
- Extract logic into custom hooks when appropriate

## Naming

- Components: PascalCase
- Variables and functions: camelCase
- Files: kebab-case or PascalCase (consistent)

## Structure

- /components for reusable UI
- /app for routing and pages
- /data for static content (projects)

## Comments

- Comment WHY, not WHAT
- Avoid redundant comments

## Styling

- Tailwind utility classes only
- Use spacing and layout utilities intentionally
