# Visual & Interaction Vibe

## Overall Feeling

- Apple-like cleanliness
- Editorial layout
- Subtle but confident motion
- High-end, not flashy

## Visual Style

- Black background
- White typography
- High contrast
- Generous whitespace
- Clear visual hierarchy

## Typography

- Sans-serif only
- Large headings
- Slightly loose letter spacing
- Minimal font variations

## Motion Principles

- Motion supports meaning, never decoration
- Prefer slow and intentional easing
- Avoid bouncy or playful motion
- Scroll should feel like scene transitions

## Inspirations

- Apple product pages
- CSS Awards featured sites
- Editorial portfolios

## Avoid

- Overly complex animations
- Excessive gradients
- Random motion without narrative
- Decorative-only effects
